Google home/Assistant Skill to teach young children maths. This skill was based on Voiceflow as it seemed an easily root to start with. The skill received over 10 updates and was finally shutdown after 5 months. This was later replaced by Mr Maths which also lasted a year.  Mr maths was a flashcard based quiz which asked one maths question per day. This was designed to help engage children with a different approach to maths via smart technology.
